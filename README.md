# Reforge/Noxel

Procedural building modeling system prototype. Basically an additional abstraction above the mesh data structure.

The implementation here is poor, but the idea was to prove navigability and interaction between multiple parts. Placing two beams in a straight line results in a single beam, simplifying the data and the resulting mesh. Placing one beam along another results in the other being split at the point of the new one, adding navigability information between the beams.
